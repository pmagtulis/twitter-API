# twitter-API

# What is this?
This is a practice notebook in using Twitter API largely copied from [**Linus Li**](https://github.com/LinusLTLi/Ukraine_Taiwan.git). 

# What is it for?

It uses Twitter API to collect tweets using specific keywords. In this example, we are looking for tweets that mention variation of names for two
presidential candidates in the 2022 Philippine polls: Leni Robredo and Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

# What do you need?

You will need to sign up for a Twitter developer account and request for **Elevated** access to run this code. You will need your own set of API keys.

*Watch out for updates on this notebook.
